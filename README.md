Changes in React Router v6
```
+ Routes introduce, no need to use exact anymore
+ NavLink usages change (active nav link)
+ useHistory() ---> useNavigate() 

```
Description
```
+ `useNavigate()` -> help to navigate to different pages, add or update query parameter dynamically.
+ `useLocation()` -> get the current URL( path ).
+ `new URLSearchParams()` -> extract the params from useLocation's search value (pure JS element).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


```
Phase 1 : Start with creating different pages
```
+ created Quote, Quote Detail and not found pages
+ Define route to navigate

```
Phase 2: Use dummy data
```
+ defined arrays of dummy data
+ Get all the data and show it to Quote page
+ Link all quote Id in view button to get particular Quote

```
Phase 3 : Replace dummy data with local storage 
```
+ created some API to interact with local storage (store and retrive quotes, thoughts etc.)
+ Created custom hook to call the APIs
    + use Reducer to perform to hold the state
